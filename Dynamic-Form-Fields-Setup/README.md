## Features

- Remove fields by clicking the "Remove" button next to each field.
- Submit the form and display the collected data in an alert box.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the basic structure of the form and loads the external CSS and JavaScript files.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the form, buttons, and layout.
- `script.js`: Handles the functionality for dynamically adding/removing fields and submitting the form.

## How to Run

1. Download all the files and place them in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click the "Add Field" button to add new fields.
4. Fill out the form and click "Submit" to view the form data.

## Customization

- You can modify the number of default fields, or change the button and form styles by editing the `style.css` file.
- JavaScript functionality can be extended or customized in `script.js`.
