## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the page and includes the style and script files.
- **style.css**: Contains the styles for the page, including layout, colors, and hover effects.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for animating the counter.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The counter will animate from 0 to a pre-defined number (1337 in this case) when the page loads.
3. You can change the `visitCount` variable in the `script.js` file to simulate different visit numbers.

## Customization

- Modify the styles in `style.css` to change the appearance of the counter.
- Replace the `visitCount` value in `script.js` with actual data from your application.
